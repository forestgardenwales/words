Welcome to our 8 acre forest garden in Ceredigion showcasing edible plants and trees. Everything we grow is entirely free of chemicals and we aim to produce 30% of the food required for a family of four and enough wood to heat our house. You don't need a large site for a forest garden - just one acre will produce an abundance of food - reducing the amount you spend on supermarket food – helping reduce airmiles and helping to tackle climate change. What's more it's fun, healthy and as low maintenance as you choose to make it.
### Description: Page
 We can help you with the design and planting of your own forest garden. And because a forest looks after itself so will a carefully designed and planted forest garden. Unlike a traditional veg patch, forest gardens enable the production of food on up to 7 layers simultaneously. Edible crops typically consist of fruit, nuts and leaves. Non edible crops consist of firewood, peasticks and willow for basketry. Many of the materials you need to be self sufficient can be obtained from your own garden. No more mowing and digging every weekend, by selecting the right plants for the right place only a minimum of pruning or tidying is required. It's cheaper, healthier, better for wildlife and low maintenance.
### Forest gardening definition
Martin Crawford describes a forest garden as “a designed agronomic system based on trees, shrubs and perennial plants. These are mixed in such a way as to mimic the structure of a natural forest – the most stable and sustainable type of ecosystem in this climate” (Martin Crawfords Web site).
