Welcome to our 8 acre forest garden in Ceredigion showcasing edible plants and trees. Everything we grow is entirely free of chemicals and we aim to produce 30% of the food required for a family of four and enough wood to heat our house. You don't need a large site for a forest garden - just one acre will produce an abundance of food - reducing the amount you spend on supermarket food – helping reduce airmiles and helping to tackle climate change. What's more it's fun, healthy and as low maintenance as you choose to make it.
