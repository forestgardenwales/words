### Profile: Paragraph
Welcome to our 8 acre forest garden in Ceredigion showcasing edible plants and trees. Everything we grow is entirely free of chemicals and we aim to produce 30% of the food required for a family of four and enough wood to heat our house. You don't need a large site for a forest garden - just one acre will produce an abundance of food - reducing the amount you spend on supermarket food – helping reduce airmiles and helping to tackle climate change. What's more it's fun, healthy and as low maintenance as you choose to make it.
### Description: Page
 We can help you with the design and planting of your own forest garden whether it be a back yard or 10 acres. Unlike a traditional veg patch, forest gardens enable the production of food on up to 7 layers simultaneously. Edible crops typically consist of fruit, nuts and leaves.

Whatever you don't pick simply stays on the tree and is either a valuable food for birds or cheaper, healthier, better for wildlife and low maintenance.
### Forest gardening definition
A forest garden is “a designed agronomic system based on trees, shrubs and perennial plants. These are mixed in such a way as to mimic the structure of a natural forest – the most stable and sustainable type of ecosystem in this climate” (Martin Crawford, Agroforestry Trust). Plants are grown on 7 layers: canopy (large trees), low tree layer (smaller trees), shrub layer, herbaceous layer, rhizosphere, ground cover layer and climbers (vertical layer). Combining plants in this way increases their resiliance by increasing their resistance to disease and enables plants which benefit each other to be grown together (such as ?)
