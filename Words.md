## Profile
Welcome to our 8 acre forest garden in Ceredigion showcasing edible plants and trees. Everything we grow is entirely free of chemicals and we aim to produce 30% of the food required for a family of four and enough wood to heat our house. You don’t need a large site for a forest garden—just one acre will produce an abundance of food, reducing the amount you spend on supermarket food—helping reduce airmiles and helping to tackle climate change. What’s more, it’s fun, healthy and as low maintenance as you choose to make it.

## Description

We can help you with the design and planting of your own forest garden whether it be a back yard or 10 acres. Unlike a traditional vegetable patch, forest gardens enable the production of food on up to 7 layers simultaneously. Edible crops typically consist of fruit, nuts and leaves. Non-edible crops consist of firewood, peasticks and willow for basketry. Many of the materials you need to be self sufficient can be obtained from your own garden. And because a natural forest looks after itself so will a carefully designed forest garden. No more mowing and digging every weekend – by selecting the right plants for the right place only a minimum of pruning or tidying is required. For example, Martin Crawford of the [Agroforestry Research Trust](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/) estimates he spends 1 day per week maintaining a 2 acre forest garden, most of which is harvesting.

More people than ever before are choosing to grow their own food. Many of us are becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of animal welfare in farming. It’s cheaper, the negative effects of monocrop production on the environment and the effect of all those pesticides on our health and on althier, better for wildlife. But the disadvantage of the traditional veg patch is the amount of time it takes. A forest garden is far less demanding on your time. Whatever you don't pick simply stays on the tree and is either a valuable food for birds or lands on the ground, becoming a source of fertilizer(?). Garden waste you would normally wheelbarrow to the compost bin can be used where it is as a ferilizer or mulch (?), saving you time and saving your back. Salad leaves can be harvested from trees rather than being pulled from the ground and replanted. , he widlife there's way less mud.

## Forest garden definition

A forest garden i ands “a designed agronomic system based on trees, shrubs and perennial plants. These are mixed in such a way as to mimic the structure of a natural forest – the most stable and sustainable type of ecosystem in this climate” (Martin Crawford, Agroforestry Trust). Plants are grown on 7 layers: canopy (large trees), low tree layer (smaller trees), shrub layer, herbaceous layer, rhizosphere, ground cover layer and climbers (vertical layer). Combining plants in this way increases their resiliance by increasing their resistance to disease and enables plants which benefit each other to be grown together (such as ?)
